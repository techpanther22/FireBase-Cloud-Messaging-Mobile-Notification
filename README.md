# FireBase-Cloud-Messaging-Mobile-Notification
This is a android project in which the developer can send the notification to all the devices having the application in their mobile phones.

User need to place their Firebase json file in the main app directory of the application.
and then it will be configured to use all the notification services. It is configured with my account as the json file contains your api key which is needed to connect to your firebase Console.
